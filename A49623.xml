            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The laſt Account from <hi>Fez,</hi> in a Letter from one of the Embaſſy to a Perſon of Honour in <hi>London,</hi> containing a Relation of Colonel <hi>Kirk</hi>'s Reception at <hi>Mequinez,</hi> by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, with ſeveral paſſages in Relation to the Affairs of <hi>Tangier.</hi>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis ſecond account of our Journey into <hi>Barbary,</hi> is a debt I owe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by my promiſe in my firſt, with Humble dependance on your Lordſhips Goodneſs to Pardon the Imperfections of both. Leaving the <hi>Alazar</hi> the 7th of <hi>February,</hi> we were Conducted on our way by the Alcade of <hi>Tituan,</hi> who uſed us with ſuch extream Care and Kindneſs, that though we met with many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects worth our Obſervation, yet nothing ſo much, as the Civility and Complement we found from the Chief Men of this Wild and Rude Race of People; in ſeven days march we arrived at <hi>Mequinez,</hi> which is the <hi>Verſailles</hi> of this Kingdom, Situated ſo well for Security and Pleaſure, that it's the choſen Seat of this King <hi>Muley Iſhmael:</hi> It has been the Houſe of the Succeſſors and Firſt Princes of the Blood; But the King refuſing to live at his Capital City of <hi>Fez,</hi> has ſo much Beautified and Enlarged this Place, that in time it will be a moſt Agreeable and Magnificent Palace. About a Muſquet ſhott off he has laid the Foundation of a New Caſtle which by the Miſery and Slavery of 500 Chriſtian Slaves continually working upon it he intends to Build in the nature of a Cittadel to contain his Guards and Houſhold. Their Lines and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations is a thin Wall with Flankers after the manner of <hi>German Bourges</hi> which though they be not rampiers of Defence againſt us in <hi>Europe,</hi> yet they are ſufficient againſt any offenſive War, they are capable of amongſt themſelves. It is a great miſtake that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us in <hi>England,</hi> of their being informed by <hi>French,</hi> and other Engineers. They ſcarcely know the uſe of Cannon, but by the direction of ſome few Chriſtian Slaves, Men they take Priſoners. The next day after our Arrival, Col. <hi>Kirk</hi> was received by the King in his Garden, being accompanied only with four of his Chiefeſt Councellors and Alcades; his Baſhaws and General Officers of the Army waiting at the Gate with the Guards. After he had delivered his Letters and made his Complement, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned more favorable anſwers then could be expected from a Prince ſo Haughty, that his Perſon is very rarely acceſſible by any body; he told him, that in return of the Honour he did him in his Complement, he would grant him four years Peace and if by any Spyes he could be informed. of a breach of Peace Committed by his Officers, he would puniſh them with extream Severity, and in great Zeal he was pleaſed to tell us we were nothing ſo much Chriſtians, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>French;</hi> they Worſhipping the Croſs and Images, but that our Opinion was much nearer Paganiſm, and that he would Pray to God to give us Grace to forſake Chriſt and follow <hi>Mahomet.</hi> After many other expreſſions in this Infidel manner he told us he referred the terms of the Treaty to <hi>Alcade Omar</hi> of <hi>Alcazor</hi> who is his Vice-Roy over all his Majeſties Dominions, and whoſe Character is ſo extraordinary as well for Goodneſs as Greatneſs, that had I as much Capacity as Zeal, I would have deſcribed it to your Lordſhip, that the King our Maſter might know how much his Majeſties affairs may be advantaged by the Honeſty and Juſtice of ſo well Principled a <hi>Moor,</hi> who has been ſo induſtriouſly kind to the Proceedings of this Treaty, that it has been his pains alone that has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63636:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it acceptable to this King who is difficult of acceſs, beyond imagination; and I am aſſured his Majeſties Embaſſadours would have met much Impoſſibilities of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, but for the uſe we made of this Diſcreet Honeſt Man; who has ſince his acquaintance with Col. <hi>Kirk</hi> ſeemed to do very much for his ſake, and by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our affairs has prepared matters for an eaſie method of concluſion; we owe great acknowledgments for his kind uſage of us, not only ſupplying us plentifully with Neceſſaries, but in as much Faſhionable Ceremony as could come from any well bred Man. After ſome time of Diſcourſe the King mounted his Horſe and at the head of his Guards drew towards a Plain, to give us the opportunity to obſerve their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Horſe-man-ſhip; which as it was very different to what I have ſeen in other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, ſo the only form I can expreſs it by, is that of Priſon baſe on Horſe back, I have ſeen in <hi>France;</hi> they dividing themſelves into two Bodies Skirmiſh and Charge by Sallies from each ſide, and after firing in full ſpeed they made their Wheel, but in ſo much confuſion, that not a word of Command can be diſtinguiſht, not ſo much as the Kings Perſon, who was in the midſt of all this tumultuous way of Fighting without the leaſt Art of Order, which makes me conclude, they are the eaſieſt People Conquered I ever ſaw. Our Ranged Armies keeping their Squadrons firm, and relieving their Charge with looſe Parties, after their own manner, muſt take their ground from them, and ſo conſequently be Maſters of the Field; but however they are a very Vigorous and Valiant Enemy, their Diſcipline proportionable to the confuſed and difficult paſſages of this Country, obſerving their Ambuſcades with the greateſt cunning and patience Imaginable; But what I find here moſt exceeding other Nations is their chief breed of Horſes which for ſhape and ſpeed are certainly the moſt Noble and Rareſt Kind in the World, their Horſes Habits and Furniture, on Feſtival daies, make up a figure of extraordinary State, and ſhew their Emulating one another in Equipage of that Nature; and though they are plain and poor in every thing elſe, yet the Trappings of their Bridles and Saddles are rich and fine to an incredible degree. The King at his return home gave us the liberty to ſee ſome of his Horſes, and the apartment of ſome of his Lyons, he keeps as Priſoners of War; but though we paſſed the Out-Courts of his Pallace, yet were not permitted to ſee the inward Lodgings, each Room being a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cabinet to lock up the Kings Treaſure of Women, who were almoſt an Army of Ladies under cruel confinement, and bare ſubſiſtance of one Mans allowance. This inſatiable Monarch ſuffers no Court to be made on the Queens ſide, but with the Majeſty and Jealouſie of a Game Cock ſtruts in his own Walls, and keeps all but Capons or Eunuchs from his Flock of Miſtreſſes; and here-if I may be bold with the Character of an Infidel Prince, he excells all Mankind in Barbarous and Bloody Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Maſſacre and Murder, being his Royal Game and Divertiſement, which that it may not cloy his Majeſty in one kind, he invents every day a new paſtime of Cruelty. The day before our Arrival he threw ſeveral <hi>Moors</hi> to his Lyons, taking great delight to ſee thoſe Lawleſs Princes Publick Executioners of Criminals. All that are Sentenc'd by the Law to die, are brought to receive their Doom from his Majeſties Sword, or Launce, which Office is not ſufficient to ſatisfy his inclinations to Blood; he deſtroys ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral every day by fits of Rage and ill humors. This violent Nature in this mighty Sultan does not only make his Common Slaves, but Chiefeſt Officers approach him with great Conſternation; which though it would be great inhumanity any where elſe, yet it's in ſome degree Neceſſary here. This Savage race of People is not to be deterred from Inſolencies and Crimes but by hourly and horrid examples of Puniſhment, and the Wheels of Government have their only motion from a conſtant and abſolute ſtream of Tyranny. As Force of Arms is the only preſervation of their State, ſo it is alone the means of attaining it: This King mounting his Throne, by ſtepping upon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Children, and ſucceſſors. So that all young Princes of the Blood, not having the Force and Affections of the Countrey at Command, are born either to a Goal, or a Halter; they never failing to confine or ſtrangle them, for the Security of him that Reigns. One of the Kings Nephews, <hi>Muley-Hamer,</hi> eſcaping this deſtiny, has the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Command of the Kingdom of <hi>Sus,</hi> the whole Country revolting to him; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew his Title to the whole Empire. By rendezvouzing a vaſt Army near
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63636:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Morocco;</hi> the King, in order to prevent him, is making great preparations for War; his Camp being three Leagues off from hence, and intends at the appearance of the next Moon, which they religiouſly obſerve as a ſignal, to take the Field; ſo that this Summer may produce conſiderable action, by the motion of two great Armies. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received invitation from the King to ſee the City of <hi>Fez,</hi> which is the Metropolis of this Kingdom, about twelve Leagues from this place, the 25th. of the laſt Month we were conveyed. out of Town by the <hi>Alcade Omar,</hi> who at that time Diſcourſing with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boy, that we had borrowed for an Interpreter, after a moſt obliging manner gave him his freedom from further Slavery, and preſented him to Col. <hi>Kirk</hi> very generouſly, deſiring him to receive him with the ſame frankneſs he gave him; which good Nature in a <hi>Moor,</hi> I ſhall always admire; The next day we arrived at that part of the City, they call <hi>New-Fez;</hi> which is divided from the old by a River, where the greater part is the Kings Pallace, the Out-Walls being of great Circumference. One of the Sultaneſſes, or Kings Wives, is a Renegado Chriſtian, who has her Court there, and her Son of the age of twelve years having the Command of this City Pallace, ſent us his Complement and Invitation to ſee him and his Court; which we did the next day, and paſſing the Out-Guards, we were conducted to a ſtately Room where the young Prince was ſeated upon a Carpet, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, attended by his Governor and other Men of Quality; who after receiving us with very civil expreſſions, gave us the liberty to look about us, and to view what was extreamly delightful, their walks being adorned with rows of Orange-Trees, that grew through a pleaſant and glittering pavement of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tyles; the Aqueducts and Canals of Water ſpringing in the middle, repreſent a moſt Pleaſant and Beautiful Scene, and Charming proſpect; for the inward apartments, their Furniture being the Queen and her train, we were not permitted to come near; ſo that from thence we were had to the largeſt and moſt ſtately Stable I ever ſaw, for length and breadth, capable to hold above 200 Horſes and ſupported with lofty Pillars of at leaſt fifty foot high, being refreſhed and cooled by artificial Vaults of Water underneath, neceſſary againſt the heats of this Climate. They uſe neither Rack nor Manger, but faſten them by the four feet in the nature of a Tramel and feed them on the ground; The next day we were conducted through the ſtreets, to take a full view of <hi>Old-Fez:</hi> Which we obſerved to be very populous and by the marks and ruines at a diſtance, to have been anciently a City extraordinary large. Former Ages have had the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to find this famous City in great Beauty and Glory, but time hath laid a rough hand upon it, and render'd it ſo deformed, that her founders would not in the leaſt know her again; which beſides ſuperiour Effects of Providence, is occaſioned by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rapine, theſe Heathens practiſe out of Ambition who ſhall Command. Their Moſques, Churches, Bathes, for Structure and Ornament are great Monuments of the Vertue and Ingenuity of their Anceſtors. But as true Religion and Learning has deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this People, ſo has all manner of Art to that degree, that by their neglect and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they muſt in half another Age become a heap of Rubbiſh and Confuſion. After paſſing the Morning in the ſtreets of the Town, the Governor did us the Honour to invite us to Dinner at his Houſe; and receiving us with the Ceremony of his Guards in their Arms, and ſeated at his Gate, after the State and Manner of the Country, Complemented us with great Reſpect and Kindneſs; the inward Courts of his Houſe delighted us extreamly, the Canale and the Water-works with rows of Orange-Trees, not being much unequal to the beauty of the Kings Pallace; our Cheer was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary plentiful, and pleaſant, after their manner, and ſerved by the Officers of his Guard with all manner of grandeur. When we entred the Houſe we were extreamly delighted; it being Furniſhed with Carpets and Hangings, after the richeſt <hi>Turky</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. The Governour and chief Magiſtrate of the City, after waiting our Dinner time, ſate down to a Collation of their own; our Table and Stools being both equal on the ground, and with brimmers of pure Element, we made a ſober concluſion of our entertainment; we diverted our ſelves three days at the place, and at our return to <hi>Mequinez,</hi> the King was pleaſed to ſend for us; and after examining our opinion of <hi>Fez,</hi> and our uſage there, he expreſſed himſelf extreamly ſatisfied with Col. <hi>Kirk;</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that as he had advanced ſo far into his Country, and put himſelf into his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63636:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Majeſties hands, he would eſteem him, as one deſerving his Princes favour by hazarding ſo much for his Service; but in return of the Value and Faith he had in his word, he ſhould find greater favour, then any Man was ever known to have from him; and though he had great reaſon to diſlike the Ambaſſadours proceedings in diſtruſt of him, and uſing him with ſo great delaies, yet for his ſake he would admit him his preſence; and told him, as long as he remained in <hi>Tangier,</hi> there ſhould never be any Gun fired at the place, but that it ſhould be furniſhed with Proviſions, and Benefits of a hearty Peace; which he believes will be more neceſſary for us at ſo far a diſtance, then a Chargeable War; he deſired Col. <hi>Kirk</hi> to furniſh him with ſome few Guns for his own ſhooting: And as he performed his promiſe to him in theſe ſmall things, he would make a faithful return in whatſoever ſhould concern a long and continued Peace. After Diſcourſing very morally of Truſt and Honour, perceiving an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Slave at his labour, his Majeſty after a very Gracious manner, gave him his Liberty, and gave him to Col. <hi>Kirk.</hi> I could enlarge upon this ſubject, but I am already guilty of Interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Lordſhips more weighty affairs; though with no other deſign, but to ſhew how much I am</p>
